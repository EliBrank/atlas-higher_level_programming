# Javascript Objects, Scopes, and Closures
Here, I am exploring Javascript's object-oriented capabilities, looking specifically at:
  How to create an object in JavaScript  
  What `this` means  
  What `undefined` means  
  Why the variable type and scope is important  
  What is a closure  
  What is a prototype  
  How to inherit one object from another
